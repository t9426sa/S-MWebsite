Due Wednesday by 10:15pm Points 170 Submitting a text entry box, a website url, or a file upload
Using the pictures you took in class, as individuals or as Project Teams you will create a "Come to RVC" website. This website will consist of at least 4 in-page-content-blocks (so a 2015+ design nomenclature that focuses on all three browser variants; desktop, tablet and mobile).

    A Come to RVC Welcome block (10 points)

        Pictures with borders (at least two, but you may choose to include more if you care to)
        Three paragraphs describing a student experience at RVC
        
        Appropriate for the content (this is a live page)
        Tall enough to scroll one full page on the iMacs here in the lab
    An Image Gallery Page Relating to RVC block (10 points)

        Consisting of 8 to 10 images of your taking
        Formatted for best loading on the web across all devices
       Text content to support the images
        Appropriate for the content (this is a live page)
        Tall enough to scroll one full page on the iMacs here in the lab
Remaining Two (2) blocks can reflect content that you choose (10 points total)
     *           Consisting of 3 paragraphs of text per block

     *           Consisting of at least one image per block

 
30pts: Selection of Color and Font

        Font selection conveys look and feel of the site (10 points)
            Must use fonts imported from Google Font Library 
            Fonts are legible and add clues to the content to draw users to vital content areas
        Must have color / size / face additions that indicate the following
            A new text piece of content on each of your content blocks (5pts over 4 pages)
        Colors are complimentary and look professional. You are creating a brand with your choices, and that brand has to sell unknown potential future students on RVC. Colors CANNOT follow design from any previous text-based projects (10 points)
 

20pts: Look and Feel of the Site

        A stylized TABLE that highlights content for your user in a formatted and easy to read manner (10 points) across all types of browser sizes (must have considerations for all three browser classes)
        Balance of text (paragraphs) and media (pictures, but may be music, video as well) elements on page on all device classes (5 points)
        Collection of elements (media, font, color, text, etc) work together on page rather, than against one another, on all device classes (5 points)
 

10pts : Navigation

a NAV panel for access to your content blocks for in-page navigation

40pts: Desktop, Tablet and Mobile Optimized

        Create a modern look and feel using a wrapper and other container classes (10 points)
        CSS descriptions for all three webpage types (traditional desktop, tablet, and mobile) (10 points)
        Tablet and Mobile descriptions change elements that are not useful / logical with sizing restrictions
      Tablet or Mobile descriptions MUST remove one container (not the image gallery) and replace it with another (10 points)
        Relative spacing / sizing to ensure that differences in the resolution of the devices you designed on are not damaging to the content on devices of other resolutions - so % rather than PX etc (10 points)
40 points : Image Gallery Function Across Devices

        Desktop version has hover type gallery that paints smaller thumbnail images to larger canvas area (10 points)
        Tablet version changes image size so that each image takes up approximately 40% of the screen (calibrated eyeball measurement), and that 2 images load side by side on tablets. No canvas area or hover over elements to be shown as they will not work on a tablet. (20 points)
        Mobile version of the site to have images take large portion of the screen (calibrated eyeball measurement) without more than one image per line. (10 points)

(-170pts): Less than Positive message for RVC (Asshole Tax)

ANY late submission will incur the standard 50% deduction penalty.

Anything missing from the projects will be considered a deduction of points. I am looking at these projects the way a client would after final payment has been made. A client isn't chasing after you for stuff, and neither am I.

If you are handing in the Project as a Project Team you MUST INDIVIDUALLY HAND IN THE PROJECT. Individuals not submitting their own copy of the Project will not be given credit. I am sticking to this!!!
